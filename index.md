**PhD candidate with comprehensive understanding of medical imaging, image / time-series analysis and machine learning**

# Brief Summary

My _Ph.D. thesis_ project involves development of **novel mathematical models** for studying the **functional connectivity of the human brain**. The connectivity maps obtained are subsequently analyzed by applying and adapting **methods from graph theory and network science** to detect the presence of neurologic abnormalities and patterns of impaired connectivity in diseased subjects. The **design of an end-to-end framework for detection of neuro-degeneration in HIV+ individuals**, an erstwhile difficult to detect complication of HIV infection, is the core focus of my work.

Additionally, I have worked on short-term projects on developing novel methods for **analyzing medical imaging data** to study the pathophysiology of various diseases (for ex. re-organization of cartilage matrix in osteoarthritis, changes in microarchitecture in bone, and radiomic profiling of solitary brain tumors). 

Prior to my graduate studies at University of Rochester, I had worked at _Philips Healthcare_ for 3 years as a **Field Service Engineer for their Imaging Systems with specialization in MR Imaging**. 

My experiences thus far have always given me the opportunity to work in highly interdisciplinary environments with close collaborations with engineers, mathematicians, neurologists, radiologists as well as skilled technicians. Hence, I have a good disposition towards teamwork, inter-personal communication and service provider-client relationships.
