**PhD candidate with comprehensive understanding of medical imaging, image / time-series analysis and machine learning**

# Brief Summary

My Ph.D. thesis project involves development of novel mathematical models for studying the functional connectivity of the human brain. The connectivity maps obtained are subsequently analyzed by applying and adapting methods from graph theory and network science to detect the presence of neurologic abnormalities and patterns of impaired connectivity in diseased subjects. The design of an end-to-end framework for detection of neuro-degeneration in HIV+ individuals, an erstwhile difficult to detect complication of HIV infection, is the core focus of my work.

Additionally, I have worked on short-term projects on developing novel methods for characterizing medical images for studying re-organization of cartilage matrix in osteoarthritis, bone strength prediction from clinical CT data and radiomic profiling of solitary brain tumors. 

Prior to my graduate studies at University of Rochester, I had worked at Philips Electronics India Ltd. for 3 years as a Field Service Engineer for their Imaging modalities with specialization in MRI systems. 

My experiences thus far have always given me the opportunity to work in highly interdisciplinary environments with close collaborations with engineers, mathematicians, neurologists, radiologists as well as skilled technicians. Hence, I have a good disposition towards teamwork, inter-personal communication and service provider-client relationships.
