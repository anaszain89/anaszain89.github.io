My current role at NVIDIA entails helping diverse R&D teams leverage the power of GPUs. My work focuses on enhancing the various aspects of pipelines (optimized training, improved inference, ehnaced deployment strategies) that can make it easier for teams to bring AI into the clinical practice. More details on what [NVIDIA is upto, especially in Healthcare](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/healthcare-life-sciences/). 

For my _PhD thesis_ project, I worked on the development of a **novel software framework** for analysis of fMRI data of the human brain. Results from this work have been published in high-ranking journals such as **Neuroimage** and **Neuroimage: Clinical**, among others. I had additionally worked on **Computer Aided Diagnostics**, using methods for image characterization and predicting the presence/absence of disease.

Prior to graduate studies I worked for three years with **Philips Healthcare**, India, as a _Field Service Engineer for Imaging Systems_ (specialization in **MRI**). 

My experiences thus far have always given me the opportunity to work in highly interdisciplinary environments with close collaborations with engineers, mathematicians, neurologists, radiologists as well as skilled technicians. I have a good disposition towards teamwork, inter-personal communication and service provider-client relationships.
